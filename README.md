# Personality Prediction System

## Project Overview

This project analyzes personality traits based on user characteristics such as age, gender, height, weight, and other physical or behavioral attributes. The goal is to explore relationships between these features and predict personality types like **Introvert** or **Extrovert** using data-driven methods.

## Data Source

* Dataset includes fields such as:

  * Name, Age, Gender
  * Height, Weight
  * Overall Personality Rating
  * Big Five Dimensions (Extroversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, Openness)

## Analysis Methods

* Data cleaning and handling missing values
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trait distributions
* Correlation analysis between personality attributes
* Predictive modeling to classify personalities (Introvert/Extrovert)

## Key Findings

* Visual and numerical insights reveal how traits like **extroversion, openness, or conscientiousness** vary across individuals.
* Feature patterns help identify which characteristics are stronger indicators of personality type.
* Identified the profile of users with **best overall personality** based on multiple metrics within the dataset.

## How to Run

* Open **`Untitled12.html`** to view the full analysis and charts.
* Requirements for running the original notebook:

  * Python
  * pandas, numpy
  * matplotlib, seaborn
  * scikit-learn
* Load the dataset and execute cells to reproduce the analysis.
